	<h2>about me</h2>
	<p> I am 27 years old and am a devoted resident of San Francisco!  I currently work at a health network called Sutter Health.  I am just finishing a year-long rotational management program where--in addition to various projects--I oversaw a Radiology Department with 28 employees.  It was a wonderful experience.  My first full-time career was in management consulting with the Boston Consulting Group, where I worked for 3 years in various locations including Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Brussels, Zurich, London, and Rotterdam.</p>

	<p>I also have had the opportunity to learn from some incredible academic institutions.  Prior to joining Sutter, I received my MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.  While there, I focused on healthcare, specifically healthcare innovation.  I had the opportunity to learn from some of the brightest minds and business leaders in the world and met some incredibly interesting people.  I received my undergraduate degree from Yale in Economics and Math.  My senior project was a proof of the Bourgain Embedding Theorem!</p>

	<p> I am an avid cook and foodie!  I love all things that sizzle, smell, and pop.  I love experimenting and trying new things - I rarely cook the same recipe twice.  My most recent adventures were a Moroccan  lamb shank tagine and homemade wonton noodle soup with braised pork.  I am already getting hungry. </p>
